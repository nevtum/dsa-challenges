[settings]
profile = black
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = true
line_length = 88
known_first_party = lc
```

The configuration I've provided does the following:
- Uses the `black` profile for compatibility with Black formatter
- Sets multi-line output to style 3 (Vertical Hanging Indent)
- Includes trailing commas
- Configures grid wrap and parentheses settings
- Sets line length to 88 (Black's default)
- Adds `lc` as a known first-party package for better import sorting

This configuration ensures consistent import sorting that works seamlessly with the Black code formatter, maintaining a clean and organized import structure.
